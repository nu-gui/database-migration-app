# Repository Maintenance

This PR includes the following improvements:

- Added repository maintenance scripts for future use
- Added GitHub Actions workflows for automated code quality checks
- Created documentation for repository maintenance
- Standardized file naming conventions (lowercase, no spaces)
- Added pre-commit configuration for future development

## Maintenance Scripts

The following maintenance scripts have been added to the repository:

- `standardize_filenames.sh` - Converts file and folder names to lowercase and removes spaces
- `improve_code_quality.sh` - Runs linting and formatting tools
- `update_dependencies.sh` - Updates dependencies to latest compatible versions
- `enhance_security.sh` - Scans for security issues and vulnerabilities
- `update_documentation.sh` - Updates or creates README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and other documentation

## GitHub Actions Workflows

- `repository-maintenance.yml` - Workflow for repository maintenance
- `pre-commit.yml` - Workflow for pre-commit checks
